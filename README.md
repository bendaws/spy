# smallpy
Smallpy is a small language interpreter written in Python. It is not really a language designed for actual use, but more as a hobby project I can work on to better my experience in Python. It's code is
hopefully very readable.

## Code Example
```py
print "Hello world"

set VariableName to 5
```
